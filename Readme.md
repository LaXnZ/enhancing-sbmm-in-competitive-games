The scenario revolves around a single player—Player142—who represents the user. This player can choose between two matchmaking modes: Solo Queue or Fixed Team. In Solo Queue mode, the system randomly forms both teams but ensures the user is always included in Team 1. In Fixed Team mode, the user can invite 1 to 4 teammates manually, mimicking a party-style queue, and the system will fill the rest of the team and generate a matching opponent team. In both modes, the system performs up to 100 iterations to find a match with high precision—meaning a minimal skill gap between the two teams. Once a highly balanced match is found, both teams are displayed along with each player’s skill rating, current rank, and points needed to reach the next rank.

What sets this prototype apart is its visual analytics layer. After each match is successfully simulated, the system generates two key visualizations. First, it displays a combined line chart showing the average skill rating by rank for both Team 1 and Team 2. This allows users to understand how each team is distributed across ranks like Bronze, Silver, Gold, and so on. Second, a skill distribution chart is created using KDE-style overlapping curves, showing how closely the players' skill scores cluster within each team. These insights help visualize the balance and competitiveness of the match beyond just numerical tables.

The underlying model and player data are loaded from Google Drive, and everything is executed within a single Colab notebook. The prototype is designed to be intuitive, fast, and educational—demonstrating how machine learning and data visualization can improve competitive gaming experiences through smarter matchmaking systems. This tool serves both as a research artifact and a hands-on demonstration of real-world SBMM mechanics in action.
