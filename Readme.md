This code evaluates the performance of a logistic regression model using 5-fold cross-validation. It begins by loading the training and validation datasets from Google Drive, combines them, and prepares the data by separating the features and target label. Before feeding the data into the model, it applies standardization, which ensures that all feature values are on the same scaleâ€”this helps improve the model's performance and stability.

Once the data is scaled, the code runs cross-validation, which means the model is trained and tested on different parts of the dataset multiple times (5 in this case). During each fold, four parts are used for training and one for testing, cycling through all combinations. This approach gives a more reliable evaluation of how well the model performs.

The script tracks four main metrics during cross-validation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. These metrics help in understanding how balanced and accurate the model is when making predictions. Finally, it visualizes each metric across all 5 folds using bar charts, giving a visual representation of consistency and overall performance.
