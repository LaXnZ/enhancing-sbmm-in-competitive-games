This code is part of the evaluation phase of a machine learning model built for Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) in competitive games, where the model is trained using player performance data and is tested to predict their skill levels.

The code begins by importing necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, along with specific modules for model evaluation from scikit-learn. It also suppresses warnings from scikit-learn to avoid unnecessary clutter in the output.

Next, the Google Drive is mounted using the drive.mount() function to access the datasets and model stored in Google Drive. This is essential for loading the preprocessed testing dataset and the trained logistic regression model.

The dataset is loaded using Pandas by reading the CSV file containing the testing data. The target variable, which represents player skill levels, is separated from the features, with the target variable being stored in y_test and the features in X_test. This separation is necessary for feeding the data into the model for prediction.

The logistic regression model that was previously trained and saved is loaded using joblib, a Python library for serializing models. This allows the trained model to be used for predictions on new, unseen data (the testing dataset).

The predictions are made using the predict() function of the loaded model, which generates predicted labels, and the predict_proba() function, which provides probabilities for each class. The probabilities are particularly useful for evaluating the model's performance on metrics like ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve.

After predictions are made, the Confusion Matrix is computed using the confusion_matrix() function from scikit-learn, which compares the true labels (y_test) with the predicted labels (y_pred). The confusion matrix provides insight into the model's performance, showing how many true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives were generated. This allows for an initial assessment of model accuracy.

The Classification Report is also generated using classification_report(), which provides detailed performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for each class in the target variable. These metrics are crucial for understanding how well the model differentiates between different player skill levels.

To further evaluate the model's performance, the AUC/ROC Curve is plotted. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. The roc_curve() function computes the false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR), which are then used to plot the ROC curve. A higher AUC indicates better performance, with an ideal value of 1. The ROC curve is visualized using Matplotlib to show how the model's performance improves across different thresholds.

Additionally, the Precision-Recall Curve is plotted using precision_recall_curve() to assess the model's performance when dealing with imbalanced data. The curve provides a trade-off between precision and recall, while the Average Precision score summarizes the curve into a single value. A high average precision score indicates that the model is making accurate predictions, especially in scenarios where there is a class imbalance.

This evaluation helps identify whether the logistic regression model is well-suited for the SBMM system, and it provides useful insights into potential areas for improvement, such as handling class imbalances or tweaking the model to optimize performance.
