The objective of this step was to compare the performance of different machine learning models using the StarCraft II Replay Analysis dataset. This dataset consists of player performance data and league rankings, which serve as a basis for predicting the skill level of players in competitive gaming scenarios.

In the process, the dataset was first loaded and preprocessed. This involved tasks such as handling missing data, feature engineering, and encoding the target variable (LeagueIndex) to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms. Once the data was prepared, several models were trained using the dataset, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes. These models were chosen due to their widespread use in classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a categorical outcome (in this case, the skill level of a player).

After training the models, their performance was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to determine how well each model could predict player skill. The models were compared against each other, and based on their performance across these metrics, the best-performing model was selected. The comparison also highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each model, which helped in deciding which model would be most suitable for further use in the matchmaking system.
