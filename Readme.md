The core idea is to simulate the matchmaking process from the perspective of a player—specifically, Player142—who is treated as the user. The simulation starts with a landing page that displays a player profile for Player142. This profile includes their predicted skill rating, current competitive rank (e.g., Gold, Platinum, Diamond), and the number of points needed to advance to the next rank. All rank assignments are computed dynamically from the model’s predicted skill score. The user is then given a “Start Simulation” button to initiate the matchmaking process.

Once the user begins, they are prompted to choose between two matchmaking modes: Solo Queue or Fixed Team. In Solo Queue mode, Player142 is matched with four random players to form Team 1, while Team 2 is filled with five other random players. The system performs up to 100 iterations to find a match where the total skill ratings between both teams are closely balanced, using a precision metric calculated as `1 / (1 + skill_difference)`. If the precision exceeds a threshold (0.8 in this case), the match is accepted and visualized.

In Fixed Team mode, the user can manually select up to four other players to form their own party team. This simulates a scenario where friends queue together in a competitive match. The remaining slots in Team 1 are filled with random players. Then, as with Solo Queue, the system attempts to form a fair opponent team using the remaining player pool and evaluates each possible match for balance. If a suitable match is found within 100 iterations, the results are displayed.

After a successful match simulation, both teams are shown in tabular form with player names, skill ratings, ranks, and progress to the next rank. Additionally, two key charts are generated for visual analysis. The first is a combined line chart that displays the average skill rating per rank category (Bronze to Grandmaster) for both teams. This chart helps to see how evenly distributed the skills are across ranks. The second visualization is a skill distribution chart that uses overlapping density curves (KDE plots) to show the spread of skill scores within each team. This provides an intuitive comparison of how tightly or loosely packed each team’s skill levels are.

Internally, the simulator uses Gradio to create the interactive interface, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visual rendering. All the necessary data and models are loaded from Google Drive, including a trained logistic regression model and a preprocessed testing dataset. Each component in the code is modularized to ensure that visualizations are regenerated after each simulation, reflecting the actual players in the selected match.

This prototype demonstrates not only the practical application of machine learning in real-time matchmaking but also how data-driven visual feedback can help users and developers understand the quality of the matches being made. It is designed to simulate a realistic SBMM environment while maintaining full transparency into team formation and player distribution.
